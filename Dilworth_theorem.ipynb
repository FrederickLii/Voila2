    "From a finite poset $P$ of $n$ elements, we can construct a bipartite graph $B_P = (P_s \\sqcup P_t, E)$ where $P_s \\cong P_t \\cong P$ and an edge $(x,y)\\in E$ if and only if $x < y \\in P$, i.e., regarded as elements in $P$, $x \\leqslant y$ and $x \\neq y$. By Kőnig's theorem, $B_P$ has a maximal matching $M$ and a minimal vertex cover $VC$ sharing the same size, denoted by $|M| = ||VC| = l$. \n",
    "- There is a one-to-one correspondence between matchings on $B_P$ and chain decompositions in $P$. Two elements are paired in the matching if and only if they are adjacent in some chain of the corresponding chain decomposition. Thus, the minimal chain decomposition has the size of $n - l$ (each unmatched element in $P_s$ is the maximal element of some chain and vice verse).\n",
    "- Given a minimal vertex covers $S \\sqcup T$ on $B_P$ with $S \\subseteq P_s$ and $T \\subseteq P_t$, $P \\setminus (S \\bigcup T)$ is antichains in $P$ with at least $n - l$ elements. (In fact, $S \\bigcap T = \\emptyset$ if $S \\sqcup T$ is a minimal vertex cover. Think about why.)\n",
